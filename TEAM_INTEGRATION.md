# NSA Site - Team Integration Complete

## Summary

Successfully integrated the complete NSA team roster (53 members) from the Google Sheet into the website, with comprehensive data cleaning, filtering, and SEO enhancements.

## What Was Done

### 1. **Team Data Ingestion Pipeline**
- Created `scripts/generate_team_json.py` to parse `data/team_raw.csv`
- Implemented data sanitization:
  - Strip invisible Unicode characters (zero-width spaces, etc.)
  - Normalize whitespace and quotes from names
  - Clean and lowercase email addresses
  - Normalize position titles (DD → Deputy Director, etc.)
  - Remove phone numbers per requirements
- Handle duplicate entries by merging roles and focus areas
- Generate structured `data/team.json` with 53 validated members

### 2. **Enhanced Flask Backend (`app.py`)**
- Added sophisticated team data processing:
  - Deduplicate and normalize focus tags
  - Generate lowercase tokens for filtering
  - Validate links dictionary structure
  - Strip and sanitize all text fields
- Implemented prioritized filter chip ordering:
  - **Wings first**: Presidential, GS, PS, Treasure, Tech
  - **Roles second**: President, Director, Deputy Director, Executive, etc.
  - **Departments third**: Alphabetical
- Generate structured data (Schema.org Person entries) for SEO
- Pass `structured_people` to template for proper JSON-LD

### 3. **Team Template Updates (`templates/team.html`)**
- Use precomputed structured data from backend
- Lowercase filter chip `data-filter` attributes for case-insensitive matching
- Add `aria-pressed` states for accessibility
- Conditionally render sections:
  - Hide bio when empty
  - Hide department/email/focus sections when not present
  - Only show GitHub/LinkedIn links if provided
- Use `focus_tokens` for case-insensitive tag matching
- Display email as clickable `mailto:` links
- Wrap social links in semantic `project-links` div

### 4. **Filter Enhancement (`static/js/main.js`)**
- Sync `aria-pressed` attribute with active filter state
- Maintain accessibility compliance for screen readers
- Case-insensitive tag matching throughout

### 5. **Consistency Updates**
- Applied same `aria-pressed` pattern to `templates/projects.html`
- Ensured uniform filter chip behavior across team and projects pages

### 6. **Static Build Verification**
- All routes tested: ✓ Index, ✓ Projects, ✓ Team, ✓ Sitemap, ✓ Robots
- Static export generated successfully
- Team page HTML validated:
  - 53 member cards rendered
  - Filter chips properly prioritized
  - Email links functional
  - Focus tags displayed correctly
  - Empty fields gracefully hidden

## Technical Improvements

### Data Quality
- Removed invisible characters that cause display issues
- Normalized "Curly hair" placeholder (kept as-is per CSV)
- Merged multi-role members (e.g., "Executive / Deputy Director")
- Handled missing departments and emails gracefully

### SEO & Accessibility
- Structured data includes email addresses when available
- Conditional inclusion of jobTitle, knowsAbout, description
- Proper ARIA states for interactive filter buttons
- Semantic HTML for contact information

### Filtering System
- **29 filter chips** covering all wings, roles, and departments
- Case-insensitive matching (filter="presidential wing" matches tag="Presidential Wing")
- Prioritized display order for better UX
- Empty state message when no results

### Performance
- Precompute structured data in backend (not in template)
- Generate focus tokens once per member
- Efficient tag matching with lowercase normalization

## Files Modified

1. **scripts/generate_team_json.py** - New data parser with sanitization
2. **data/team.json** - Regenerated with 53 clean entries
3. **data/team_raw.csv** - Raw spreadsheet data (no phone numbers)
4. **app.py** - Enhanced team route with filtering and structured data
5. **templates/team.html** - Conditional rendering and accessibility
6. **templates/projects.html** - Consistent filter aria-pressed
7. **static/js/main.js** - Aria-pressed sync for filters
8. **test_routes.py** - Validation script for all routes
9. **public/** - Regenerated static site

## Verification

```bash
# Test all routes
python test_routes.py
# Output: All routes return 200 OK

# Regenerate team data
python scripts/generate_team_json.py
# Output: Wrote 53 members to data\team.json

# Build static site
python build_static.py
# Output: public/ directory populated

# Check team page

```

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Add member photos**: Extend JSON with `"photo": "img/team/name.jpg"`
2. **Bio content**: Populate bio field for leadership team
3. **Social links**: Add GitHub/LinkedIn for technical members
4. **Department logos**: Display school/department badges
5. **Search functionality**: Add real-time name/email search
6. **Role descriptions**: Hover tooltips explaining each position
